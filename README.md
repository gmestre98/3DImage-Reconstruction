# 3DImage-Reconstruction <h1>

# Image Processing and Vision project

This was my image processing and vision course project in which we were asked to develop a matlab function in a precise and well thought way so it could solve the problem of reconstructing a 3D scene using images taken with a kinnect(depth and rgb image).

To this it was done an implementation using an outlier detection method(RANSAC), and then solved the procrustes problem to obtain transformations from all images to the first image coordinates.
